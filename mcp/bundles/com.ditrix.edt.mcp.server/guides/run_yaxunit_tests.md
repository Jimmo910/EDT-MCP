Launches the 1C:Enterprise application with the `RunUnitTests` startup parameter, polls until the launch terminates or the polling window expires, then parses the JUnit XML report and returns a Markdown summary. The full Markdown report is also written to `report.md` next to `junit.xml` so you can read it directly from disk.

## When to use

Use after writing or changing test code to verify it. Prerequisites: an existing runtime-client launch configuration for the project/application, and the YAXUnit extension installed in the target infobase. Without YAXUnit no JUnit XML is produced and the tool returns an error.

## Parameter details

Two ways to identify the launch:

- `launchConfigurationName` (preferred) — the exact runtime-client config name from `list_configurations`. When set, `projectName` and `applicationId` are derived from it.
- `projectName` + `applicationId` — required together when `launchConfigurationName` is omitted. Get the application id from `get_applications`.

Optional test filters (each an array of names, AND-combined; a comma-separated string is also accepted):

- `extensions` — restrict to tests in these extensions.
- `modules` — restrict to these test modules.
- `tests` — individual tests in `Module.Method` format.

Control:

- `timeout` — polling window in seconds (default 60). See ## Polling and Pending.
- `updateBeforeLaunch` — auto-chain, default `true`. See ## Auto-chain.
- `updateScope` — which projects to force-recompute + update before the run when `updateBeforeLaunch=true`: `all` (configuration + dependent extensions, default), `configuration`, or `extension:<ProjectName>` (comma-separate several). See ## Auto-chain.

## Polling and Pending

The tool polls for up to `timeout` seconds. If the launch finishes in that window it returns the parsed JUnit report. If the window expires while the launch is still running it returns **Pending** and does NOT terminate the launch. Call the tool again with the SAME arguments to keep waiting and fetch the result once the launch completes. A run key is derived from the config name plus the filter, so identical arguments reattach to the in-flight launch instead of starting a new one. If the launch finished BETWEEN your calls, the retry returns the completed report exactly once (regardless of `updateBeforeLaunch` — the result is from the fresh run you started); only the call after that fetch starts a new run. A fresh report (under a few minutes old) is served from cache ONLY when `updateBeforeLaunch=false`; with the default `updateBeforeLaunch=true` the cache is bypassed so a freshly edited test always re-runs (an in-flight or finished-but-unfetched launch is still reattached/returned, never restarted).

## Auto-chain (updateBeforeLaunch)

Default `true`: before spawning a new test launch, the tool FORCES a derived-data recompute (`recomputeAll`) of the project AND its dependent EXTENSION (`.cfe`) projects, waits for the workspace build and derived data to settle, politely terminates any live 1C client running this configuration, then runs a silent database update — so a test you just edited inside an extension is force-rebuilt and its regenerated `.cfe` is loaded into the infobase before the run (not executed stale), and EDT's launch delegate does not pop its modal 'Update database?' dialog that would otherwise block the MCP call. It then waits until the infobase actually reports UPDATED (via EDT's own update-state event) before starting; if the IB cannot be brought in sync in time it REFUSES to run with a clear out-of-sync error rather than producing a stale-green result. Set `false` to keep legacy behaviour (the delegate decides; the dialog may appear and block; no extension-rebuild, so a freshly edited extension may run stale). If pre-launch preparation fails because a previous launch is stuck, call `terminate_launch` with `force=true` and retry.

`updateScope` narrows the recompute+update: `all` (default) covers the configuration plus its dependent extensions; `configuration` covers just the launch project; `extension:<ProjectName>` (comma-separate several) covers the configuration plus only the named extension project(s) — the fast path when only one extension changed. The configuration project is always included, since an extension cannot reach the infobase without its parent configuration. An unknown extension project name is a HARD ERROR: the call fails fast (before terminating any live client) with a message listing the requested-but-unknown names and the available extension projects — a typo'd name silently skipping the recompute would produce exactly the stale run this parameter prevents. Names are case-sensitive. As an optimization, the short post-recompute settle wait is skipped when no infobase update-state change was observed while the recompute ran.

## Debug mode (debug=true)

Pass `debug=true` to launch in DEBUG mode so breakpoints set with `set_breakpoint` trip. Then the tool does NOT poll (it ignores `timeout`): it returns a Markdown launch handle immediately and you call `wait_for_break` next. The full cycle:

```
set_breakpoint -> run_yaxunit_tests(debug=true) -> wait_for_break
  -> get_variables / evaluate_expression / step -> resume
```
Pin to ONE test (`tests`) so exactly one breakpoint trips. The deprecated `debug_yaxunit_tests` tool is a thin alias for this.

## Examples

Run all tests via a named config:

```json
{ "launchConfigurationName": "TestClient" }
```

Run by project + application, filtered to two modules:

```json
{ "projectName": "MyProject", "applicationId": "<id-from-get_applications>", "modules": ["Tests_Catalog", "Tests_Document"] }
```

Run a single test method with a longer window:

```json
{ "launchConfigurationName": "TestClient", "tests": "Tests_Catalog.CreateAndPost", "timeout": 180 }
```

## Notes

- Response type is Markdown; the report is also saved to `report.md` next to `junit.xml`.
- The temp/report directory is not deleted on completion so a later call can re-fetch it.
- Module and test names are 1C identifiers (programmatic `Name`), not synonyms.

## Gotchas

- A timeout returns **Pending**, not a failure — do not retry with different arguments; reuse the same ones so the run key matches.
- If no JUnit XML appears after the launch finishes, the YAXUnit extension is likely not installed in the infobase, or the filter matched no tests.
- The config must be a runtime-client launch configuration; other types are rejected.
