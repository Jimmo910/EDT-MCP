Runs EDT's own configuration validation (the same check engine and marker set `get_project_errors` exposes) scoped to a single XDTO package, and reports a pass/fail verdict. It is a thin, read-only wrapper: the `fqn` you pass is checked to resolve to an `XDTOPackage` top object, then the request is delegated to `get_project_errors` with an `objects` filter of `[fqn]`, and the returned Markdown is reframed with a one-line verdict.

## When to use
- After authoring/editing an XDTO package (`create_metadata` / `modify_metadata` / `delete_metadata` on `XDTOPackage.<Name>...`), confirm it is still valid - e.g. after deleting an `ObjectType` that another `Property` referenced.
- As a scoped alternative to `get_project_errors` when you only care about ONE package and want the "is it valid" question answered directly instead of reading a raw problem table.

## Parameter details
- `projectName` - EDT project name (required).
- `fqn` - the package to validate, as `XDTOPackage.<Name>` (required). Must already exist. An FQN that does not resolve, or resolves to something other than an XDTOPackage (e.g. a Catalog, or an `ObjectType`/`Property` member FQN), is rejected with an actionable error - point this tool at the PACKAGE, not a member inside it.
- `limit` - max problem rows; default 100, max 1000.

The verdict always considers EVERY severity (a severity-filtered "no matches" would not be a validity guarantee), so there is intentionally no `severity` parameter - use `get_project_errors` if you need to filter by severity.

## Output
- Valid: `**XDTO package `XDTOPackage.<Name>` is valid** - no problems reported.` with no table below it.
- Invalid: `**XDTO package `XDTOPackage.<Name>`: problems found**` followed by the SAME Markdown problem table `get_project_errors` renders (`Description` / `Location` / `Module path` / `Line` / `Check code`).

## Gotchas
- This reads EDT's ALREADY-COMPUTED validation markers - it does not force a fresh compile/revalidation. If you just made an edit and want up-to-the-second results, call `revalidate_objects` (or `clean_project`) first, then `validate_xdto_package`.
- The scoping uses the RESOLVED package's canonical FQN with EXACT (segment-boundary) matching: a problem on the package itself or on a member strictly under it (an `ObjectType` / `Property`, whose presentation is `XDTOPackage.<Name>....`) is included, while a prefix-sharing SIBLING package (`XDTOPackage.<Name>2`) is not - so the verdict is about THIS package only. (`get_project_errors` on its own uses looser substring matching; this tool opts into the exact mode.)
- This tool implements NO XDTO-specific validation rule of its own; it is strictly a scoped view over EDT's existing checks. It will not catch anything `get_project_errors` (with the matching `objects` filter) would not also show.

## Examples
- `{projectName: "MyConfig", fqn: "XDTOPackage.Orders"}` - full validation, default limit.
- `{projectName: "MyConfig", fqn: "XDTOPackage.Orders", limit: 500}` - raise the reported-row cap.
- A non-package FQN (`{projectName: "MyConfig", fqn: "Catalog.Products"}`) is rejected: use `get_project_errors` directly for a non-XDTO-scoped query.
